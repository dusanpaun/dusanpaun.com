<h1>COURSES AND EDUCATION</h1>

<p class="subtext">
    <b>“An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.” –  Benjamin Franklin</b>
</p>

<p class="subtext">
    As many of IT people here can relate, I have never expected to end up in
    System administration and DevOps. I'm having a bachelor's degree in
    Electronics and Telecommunication.
</p>

<p class="subtext">
    Here I will share with you what I'm learning now and what have I learned.
    So that you can have a quick grasp of my interests and knowledge.
</p>

<p class="subtext">
    Nearly all courses, books and certifications here are for my professional career needs. Rarely do you see
    that I learn something only because of lack of free time. Unfortunately, being
    ever accessible DevOps and System Admin for my company during pandemics, loving
    and caring husband and father is more important.
</p>

<p class="subtext">
    Anyhow, I will eventually create a stable foundation regarding knowledge.</br>
    Since I never have been dreaming to land in this field of work or working with these
    technologies daily.
</p>

<h1>PRIVACY</h1>
<p class="subtext">
    I have started to wrestle with a Godzilla know as Google. Honestly, I am scared of what will happen to this society. When you look around you, corporations everywhere are more in control of your life than ever before.
</p>

<p class="subtext">
    ML, AI, AR, and other two-letter slogans are great things but in the right hands. I do not want to imagine what will the future looks like when we need to fight more and more for leftover fragments of our personal life.
</p>

<p class="subtext">
    To return to wrestling Godzilla, I am decentralizing from Google. I thought that this is to be a big deal, but it is! On every spot, you will see how not using Google or Google services is just a step back. But privacy should not be a feature it is a requirement.
</p>

<h1>FAMILY</h1>
<p class="subtext">
    My family goes first and will be that way always! This is maybe a strong opinion right up front, but as I am newly baked father, I pledged to be there as she grows up.
</p>

<p class="subtext">
    If quarantine time learned me something while working 16 to 18 hours every day to achieve deadlines, is that you sometimes need to work weekends and extra hours. But sometimes I will say no if you ask me to work the whole weekend and also there will be days when I will close down my laptop at 4 or 5 pm and will not open it till next day morning.
</p>
